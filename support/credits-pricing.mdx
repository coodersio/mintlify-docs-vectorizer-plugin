### Credit Costs

## Credit Expiration

<Warning>
  **Credits expire after 6 months** from the date of purchase.
</Warning>

### How Expiration Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase Credits">
    You buy a credit pack today (e.g., January 1, 2025)

    **Expiration date**: July 1, 2025 (6 months later)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Expiration Warnings">
    You'll see warnings in the plugin:

    - 🟡 **7 days before**: Yellow warning badge
    - 🔴 **3 days before**: Red urgent warning
    - ⚫ **After expiration**: Credits become unavailable
  </Step>

  <Step title="Renewal Resets Expiration">
    **Key benefit**: Buying new credits resets the expiration date for **all** your credits!

    **Example**:
    - Day 170: You have 50 credits expiring in 10 days
    - You buy 100 more credits
    - **All 150 credits** now expire in 6 months from Day 170
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Buy credits before they expire to reset the clock on your existing balance. No credits ever wasted!
</Tip>

### What Happens When Credits Expire

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before Expiration">

    - ✓ Full access to all features
    - ✓ Preview and convert normally
    - ✓ Credits available for use
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Expiration Warning">

    **7 days before**:
    - 🟡 Yellow badge appears
    - Message: "Credits expire in X days"
    - Suggestion: "Buy now to extend expiry"

    **3 days before**:
    - 🔴 Red badge (more urgent)
    - Message: "Expires in X days!"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="After Expiration">

    - ⚫ Credits become unavailable
    - Cannot preview or convert
    - Need to purchase new credits

## Pricing Transparency

We believe in transparent pricing. Here's the breakdown:

### What Your Credits Pay For

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="API Costs" icon="server">
    **~60% of price**

    Vectorizer.ai API processing fees
  </Card>

  <Card title="Infrastructure" icon="cloud">
    **~20% of price**

    Servers, storage, bandwidth
  </Card>

  <Card title="Development" icon="code">
    **~20% of price**

    Plugin updates, support, features
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why We Don't Offer Free Tier

<Accordion title="API costs make free tier unsustainable">
  **Vectorizer.ai charges us per conversion**:

  - Preview: ~$0.01 per request
  - Full conversion: ~$0.06 per request

  **If we offered 10 free conversions**:
  - Cost to us: $0.60 per user
  - With 10,000 users: $6,000/month
  - Unsustainable without revenue

  **Our solution**: Cheap previews (2 credits = $0.04-$0.08) let you test before committing to full conversion.
</Accordion>

### Price Comparison

**Compared to alternatives**:

| Service | Price | Model | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Vectorized (AI Vectorizer) - Image Tracer** | $0.20-$0.40 | Pay per use | In Figma, instant |
| Vectorizer.ai (web) | $9.99/mo | Subscription | 100/month, leave Figma |
| Adobe Illustrator | $20.99/mo | Subscription | Image Trace, expensive |
| Manual tracing | $25-100 | Per logo | Freelancer rates |

**Our advantage**: No subscription, use in Figma, professional quality.
