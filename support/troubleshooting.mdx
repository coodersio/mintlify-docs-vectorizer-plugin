## Installation & Loading Issues

### Plugin Won't Load or Shows Blank Screen

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Internet Connection">
    **Symptom**: Plugin panel is blank or shows loading spinner forever

    **Solution**:
    1. Verify internet connection (try loading a website)
    2. Check if firewall/VPN is blocking plugin
    3. Disable VPN temporarily and retry
    4. Try different network if possible

    **Why**: Plugin requires online access to communicate with Vectorizer.ai API
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Figma">
    **Symptom**: Plugin crashes or won't open

    **Solution**:
    - **Desktop**: Help → Check for Updates
    - **Browser**: Refresh page (`Cmd/Ctrl + R`)
    - Ensure you're on latest Figma version

    **Why**: Outdated Figma may have compatibility issues
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clear Cache (Browser Version)">
    **Symptom**: Plugin loads but behaves strangely

    **Solution**:
    1. Clear browser cache and cookies
    2. Hard refresh Figma (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R`)
    3. Reload plugin

    **Why**: Cached files may be corrupted or outdated
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart Figma (Desktop Version)">
    **Symptom**: Plugin won't respond or freezes

    **Solution**:
    1. Completely quit Figma (don't just close window)
    2. Wait 10 seconds
    3. Reopen Figma
    4. Launch plugin again

    **Why**: Clears memory and resets plugin state
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reinstall Plugin">
    **Last resort solution**:

    1. Remove plugin:
       - Resources (`Shift + I`) → Plugins
      - Right-click **Vectorized (AI Vectorizer) - Image Tracer**
       - Select "Remove plugin"
    2. Reinstall from [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1528574912559745892/vectorized-ai-vectorizer-image-tracer)
    3. Accept all permissions when prompted

    **Why**: Fresh installation fixes corrupted files
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Still not working?**

## Image Selection Issues

### No Image Preview Appears

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Symptom: Selected node but no preview" icon="image-slash">
    **Common causes and solutions**:

    **1. Node doesn't have image fill**
    - **Check**: Look at Fill panel in Figma
    - **Should see**: "Image" fill type
    - **Solution**: Make sure selected layer actually contains image

    **2. Image not fully loaded**
    - **Check**: Is image blurry or low-res in Figma?
    - **Wait**: For image to fully load
    - **Try**: Reselecting after image loads

    **3. Unsupported format**
    - **Supported**: PNG, JPG/JPEG with image fill
    - **Not supported**: SVG, PDF, GIF, video
    - **Solution**: Convert to PNG first

    **4. Hidden or locked layer**
    - **Check**: Layer visibility (eye icon)
    - **Check**: Layer locked status (lock icon)
    - **Solution**: Unlock and make visible
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quick fix: Copy-paste as fill" icon="copy">
    **If image won't be detected**:

    1. Copy the image (`Cmd/Ctrl + C`)
    2. Create a rectangle (`R` key)
    3. With rectangle selected, paste (`Cmd/Ctrl + V`)
    4. Image becomes fill of rectangle
    5. Select rectangle and try plugin again

    **This works 95% of the time** when detection fails!

## Conversion Quality Issues

### Edges Look Jagged or Blocky

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Problem">

    **Symptoms**:
    - Curves have "stair-stepping"
    - Edges not smooth
    - Rough appearance when zoomed

    **Especially noticeable**:
    - On circular shapes
    - Curved text
    - Logos with flowing lines
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Solution">
    **Increase Quality setting**:

    1. Move **Quality** slider to **High** or **Ultra**
    2. Use HD Preview to compare (2 credits)
    3. Convert when satisfied

    **Why it works**:
    - Higher quality = tighter curve fitting
    - More anchor points = smoother curves
    - Trade-off: Larger file size

    **Alternative**: If quality is already Ultra, source image may be too low-res

    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Too Many Dots, Noise, or Artifacts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Problem">

    **Symptoms**:
    - Tiny dots everywhere
    - JPG compression squares as shapes
    - Paper texture in scanned images
    - Messy, complex output

    **Common in**:
    - JPEG logos from websites
    - Scanned documents
    - Low-quality screenshots
    - Photos
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Solution">
    **Decrease Detail setting**:

    1. Move **Detail** slider LEFT (toward "Less")
    2. Try Detail value of **25-35**
    3. Preview to check if noise removed
    4. Lower more if needed (down to 15-20)

    **Why it works**:
    - Lower detail = removes smaller shapes
    - JPG artifacts are small shapes
    - Aggressive filtering = cleaner output

    **Also try**:
    - Using **Logo** preset (Detail 30 default)
    - Increasing contrast of source image before converting

    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Colors Are Wrong or Limited

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Problem">

    **Symptoms**:
    - Colors look posterized/banded
    - Subtle color variations lost
    - Gradients have visible steps
    - Wrong shades

    **Common in**:
    - Illustrations with many colors
    - Photos
    - Gradient-heavy graphics
    - Artwork with subtle shading
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Solution">
    **Increase Colors setting**:

    1. Open **Colors** dropdown
    2. Select higher value: **64** or **256**
    3. Or select **Unlimited** (0)
    4. Preview to compare

    **Why it works**:
    - More colors = more accurate representation
    - Gradients preserved better
    - Subtle variations captured

    **Trade-offs**:
    - Larger file sizes
    - More complex for editing
    - Longer processing time

    **Alternative**: Use Custom Palette if specific colors needed

    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Lost Important Details

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Problem">

    **Symptoms**:
    - Fine lines disappeared
    - Small features missing
    - Texture oversimplified
    - Looks "too clean"

    **Common in**:
    - Hand-drawn sketches
    - Detailed artwork
    - Textured illustrations
    - Complex patterns
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Solution">
    **Increase Detail setting**:

    1. Move **Detail** slider RIGHT (toward "More")
    2. Try Detail value of **65-75**
    3. Preview to verify details preserved
    4. Increase more if needed (up to 90-100)

    **Why it works**:
    - Higher detail = keeps smaller shapes
    - Fine lines preserved
    - Texture retained

    **Also consider**:
    - Switching to **High-Fidelity** preset
    - Increasing **Quality** to High/Ultra
    - Using higher-resolution source image

    **Trade-offs**:
    - May include some noise
    - Larger file sizes
    - More complex output

    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Wrong Style (Need Strokes Instead of Fills)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Problem">
    **Symptom**: Converted sketch has filled shapes instead of strokes

    **Example**: Hand-drawn lines became solid shapes, not outlines

    **Why it happened**: Used Fill preset instead of Line Art
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Solution">
    **Use correct Draw Style**:

    1. Select **Line Art** preset
       - OR manually set **Draw Style** to "Stroke Shapes"
    2. Adjust **Stroke Width** (2-4px typical)
    3. Convert again

    **Alternative - Fix after converting**:
    - In Figma: Right-click → "Outline Stroke"
    - Converts strokes to fills if needed
    - Or vice versa with stroke effects

    **When to use each**:
    - **Fill**: 90% of cases (logos, icons, illustrations)
    - **Stroke**: Line art, sketches, outlines
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Performance & Processing Issues

### Conversion Takes Too Long (> 2 Minutes)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Normal processing times" icon="clock">
    **Expected durations**:

    | Preset | Image Complexity | Expected Time |
    |--------|-----------------|---------------|
    | Logo | Simple | 5-10 sec |
    | Illustration | Medium | 10-20 sec |
    | Line Art | Medium | 15-25 sec |
    | High-Fidelity | Complex | 30-90 sec |

    **If longer than 2 minutes**: Something is wrong
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Solution 1: Check internet speed" icon="wifi">
    **Slow upload = slow processing**:

    1. Test internet speed (speedtest.net)
    2. If slow, try different network
    3. Close bandwidth-heavy apps
    4. Try again

    **Why**: Your image uploads to API, results download back
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Solution 2: Reduce image complexity" icon="compress">
    **Simplify the conversion**:

    1. **Lower Quality**: Use Standard instead of Ultra
    2. **Reduce Detail**: Lower to 30-40
    3. **Limit Colors**: Use 32 instead of 256
    4. **Resize source**: If over 3000px, resize smaller

    **Why**: Complex settings + large images = longer processing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Solution 3: Avoid High-Fidelity for testing" icon="gem">
    **High-Fidelity is slow by design**:

    - Can take 60-90 seconds normally
    - Not a bug, just computationally intensive
    - Use **Illustration** for testing
    - Only use High-Fidelity for final output

    **Tip**: Preview with Illustration, convert with High-Fidelity if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="If stuck for 3+ minutes" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Likely failed silently**:

    1. Refresh Figma (`Cmd/Ctrl + R`)
    2. Relaunch plugin
    3. Try again with simpler settings
    4. If persists, contact support

    **Check**: Credits should be refunded if failed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### File Size Too Large

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Problem">
    **Symptoms**:
    - SVG file over 500 KB (for simple graphics)
    - Over 2 MB (even for complex art)
    - Figma lags when editing
    - Export takes forever

    **Causes**:
    - High-Fidelity preset
    - Ultra quality
    - Very high Detail (80-100)
    - 256 colors or Unlimited
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Solution">
    **Reduce file size strategies**:

    **Before converting** (best approach):
    1. Lower **Quality** to Standard or High
    2. Reduce **Detail** to 30-50
    3. Limit **Colors** to 16-32
    4. Use **Logo** or **Illustration** preset (not High-Fidelity)

    **After converting**:
    1. Select SVG paths in Figma
    2. Right-click → **Simplify**
    3. Reduces anchor points
    4. Smaller file, slightly less accurate

    **Also try**:
    - **Flatten** shapes (Right-click → Flatten)
    - Delete invisible/unnecessary paths
    - **Boolean operations** to merge shapes

    **File size targets**:
    - Logos: 5-50 KB
    - Icons: 10-100 KB
    - Illustrations: 50-200 KB
    - Complex art: 200-500 KB
    - Over 500 KB: Probably too large
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
