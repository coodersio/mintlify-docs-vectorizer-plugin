  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from Vectorizer.ai website?" icon="arrows-left-right">
    **Vectorized plugin**:
    - ✓ Works directly in Figma (no file uploads)
    - ✓ Pay-per-use (no subscription)
    - ✓ SVG automatically placed in canvas
    - ✓ Instant editing after conversion

    **Vectorizer.ai website**:
    - Requires leaving Figma
    - $9.99/month subscription (100 conversions)
    - Manual download and import
    - Separate workflow

    **Both use the same AI engine**, but our plugin offers Figma-native convenience!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need a Vectorizer.ai account?" icon="user">
    **No separate account needed!**

    - Plugin works with your existing Figma account
    - Credits tied to your Figma User ID
    - No additional sign-up required
    - Purchase credits directly in the plugin

    Your Figma account is all you need.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a free trial?" icon="gift">
    **No free credits currently**, but we offer:

    - **Starter Pack**: $4 for 100 credits (~10 conversions)
    - **HD Preview**: Only 2 credits to test before converting
    - **No subscription**: Pay once, use for 6 months

    **Why no free trial**:
    - Vectorizer.ai API charges us per conversion
    - Free tier would be unsustainable
    - $4 starter pack is our "trial" offer

    **Pro tip**: Use HD Preview (2 credits) to test multiple images cheaply!

## Usage Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which preset should I use?" icon="sliders">
    **Quick decision guide**:

    | Image Type | Recommended Preset |
    |------------|-------------------|
    | Company logo, app icon | **Logo** |
    | Flat illustration, UI graphic | **Illustration** ⭐ |
    | Hand sketch, line drawing | **Line Art** |
    | Complex art, photo | **High-Fidelity** |
    | **Not sure?** | **Illustration** |

    ⭐ **Illustration preset** works great for 90% of images. Start there!

    [Deep dive into presets →](/user-guide/understanding-presets)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does my conversion look different from the preview?" icon="not-equal">
    **Small differences are normal** due to:

    1. **Preview is PNG** (rasterized representation)
    2. **Final is SVG** (true vector with precise math)
    3. **Rendering differences** between web and Figma

    **Usually differences are minor (less than 5%)** and expected.

    **If drastically different**:
    - Check if you changed settings after preview
    - Make sure you clicked "Convert" (not "Preview" again)
    - Try converting again with same settings
    - [Contact support](/support/troubleshooting) if consistently wrong
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I vectorize text?" icon="font">
    **Not recommended!**

    **Why**:
    - Text in Figma is already vector (scalable)
    - Vectorizing converts to shapes (loses editability)
    - Can't change font or text content after

    **Better approach**:
    1. Use Figma's text tool directly
    2. If you need outlined text: Select text → Type → "Outline Stroke" (`Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + O`)

    **Only vectorize text** if it's part of a logo/image you're converting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the maximum image size I can convert?" icon="expand">
    **Technical limits**:
    - **Max file size**: 50 MB
    - **Max dimensions**: 10,000 × 10,000 pixels
    - **Recommended**: Under 5,000 × 5,000 for best results

    **Larger images**:
    - Take longer to process
    - May produce larger SVG files
    - Could timeout (>2 minutes)

    **Best practice**:
    - Resize huge images to 3,000-4,000px max dimension
    - Quality won't improve past certain size
    - Smaller = faster processing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I batch convert multiple images?" icon="layer-group">
    **Not currently supported.**

    **Current workflow** (one at a time):
    1. Select first image
    2. Convert
    3. Select next image
    4. Repeat

    **Workaround**: Use Quick Actions (`Cmd/Ctrl + /`) to launch the plugin quickly for each image.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does it work with vector images (SVG)?" icon="shapes">
    **No, only raster/bitmap images.**

    **Supported formats**:
    - ✓ PNG
    - ✓ JPG/JPEG
    - ✓ Any Figma node with image fill

    **Not supported**:
    - ❌ Existing SVG (already vector!)
    - ❌ PDF
    - ❌ GIF
    - ❌ Video
    - ❌ Figma vector shapes

    **Why**: SVG is already vector format—no conversion needed!

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conversion is taking too long (>2 minutes)" icon="hourglass">
    **Normal processing times**:

    | Preset | Expected Time |
    |--------|---------------|
    | Logo | 5-10 seconds |
    | Illustration | 10-20 seconds |
    | Line Art | 15-25 seconds |
    | High-Fidelity | 30-90 seconds |

    **If longer than 2 minutes**:

    **Possible causes**:
    - Very large/complex image
    - Slow internet connection
    - Server congestion (rare)

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Wait**: High-Fidelity can take up to 90 seconds
    2. **Check internet**: Slow connection = slow processing
    3. **Reduce complexity**:
       - Lower Quality to Standard
       - Decrease Detail setting
       - Use smaller image
    4. **Avoid High-Fidelity** for testing

    **If stuck for 3+ minutes**: Refresh plugin and try again. Contact support if persists.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Result has too many dots/noise" icon="circle-dot">
    **This is a Detail setting issue.**

    **Problem**: Detail set too high → preserves JPG artifacts and noise

    **Solution**:
    1. **Lower Detail** slider (move left toward "Less")
    2. Try Detail value of **30-40**
    3. Use HD Preview (2 credits) to test
    4. Adjust until clean

    **Why it happens**:
    - JPG compression creates noise
    - Scanned images have paper texture
    - Screenshots have artifacts

    **Preset recommendations**:
    - Logo preset (Detail 30) - Aggressive noise removal
    - Illustration (Detail 50) - Balanced
    - Reduce manually if needed

    [Learn about Detail →](/user-guide/core-settings)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Colors are wrong or limited" icon="palette">
    **This is a Colors setting issue.**

    **Problem**: Colors setting too low → color quantization

    **Solution**:
    1. **Increase Colors** from dropdown
    2. Try **64** or **256** colors
    3. Or select **Unlimited** (0)
    4. Preview and compare

    **Why it happens**:
    - Preset has color limit (e.g., Logo = 16 colors)
    - Algorithm reduces colors for simplification
    - Good for simple graphics, bad for complex ones

    **When to limit colors**:
    - ✓ Simple logos (8-16 colors)
    - ✓ Icons (4-8 colors)
    - ✓ Clean illustrations (16-32)

    **When to increase**:
    - Complex illustrations (64-256)
    - Photos (256 or Unlimited)
    - Gradients (256 or Unlimited)

    [Learn about Colors →](/user-guide/core-settings)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Edges look jagged/blocky" icon="stairs">
    **This is a Quality setting issue.**

    **Problem**: Quality set too low → rough curves

    **Solution**:
    1. **Increase Quality** slider
    2. Try **High** or **Ultra**
    3. Preview to see improvement
    4. Convert when satisfied

    **Why it happens**:
    - Draft/Standard quality uses looser curve fitting
    - Faster processing, less precision
    - Noticeable when zoomed in

    **Quality guide**:
    - **Draft**: Quick tests only
    - **Standard**: Daily use (good enough for most)
    - **High**: Print, large displays
    - **Ultra**: Maximum precision

    **Trade-off**: Higher quality = larger files + slower processing

## Results & Editing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I edit the SVG after converting?" icon="pen-to-square">
    **Your SVG is a native Figma vector!** Use all normal Figma tools:

    **Change colors**:
    1. Double-click SVG to enter group
    2. Select individual shapes
    3. Change fill colors in right panel

    **Edit paths**:
    1. Double-click shape to enter vector edit mode
    2. Drag anchor points
    3. Adjust bezier handles
    4. Add/delete points

    **Modify structure**:
    - Boolean operations (Union, Subtract, Intersect)
    - Flatten overlapping shapes
    - Simplify complex paths
    - Create components

    [Full editing guide →](/getting-started/quick-start#step-5-edit-your-vector-in-figma)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I re-convert an image with different settings?" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Yes! Convert as many times as you want.**

    **Workflow**:
    1. Select original image again
    2. Adjust settings (try different preset or parameters)
    3. Preview (2 credits) or Convert (10 credits)
    4. Compare results
    5. Keep the best one

    **Cost**: Each conversion costs credits (10 per SVG, 2 per preview)

    **Tip**: Use cheap previews (2 credits) to test multiple settings before final conversion!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="File size is too large—how do I reduce it?" icon="file">
    **Multiple strategies**:

    **1. Adjust settings before converting**:
    - Lower **Quality** (Standard instead of Ultra)
    - Reduce **Detail** (fewer small shapes)
    - Limit **Colors** (16-32 instead of 256)
    - Avoid **High-Fidelity** preset

    **2. Simplify after converting**:
    - Select SVG paths
    - Right-click → **Simplify**
    - Reduces anchor points
    - Smaller file, slightly less accurate

    **3. Flatten shapes**:
    - Select SVG
    - Right-click → **Flatten** (`Cmd/Ctrl + E`)
    - Merges overlapping paths
    - Can reduce complexity

    **4. Use different preset**:
    - Logo preset: Smallest files (5-50 KB)
    - Illustration: Medium (50-200 KB)
    - High-Fidelity: Largest (500 KB-2 MB)
