## Your First Vectorization in 5 Minutes

Follow this guide to convert your first bitmap image into a beautiful, editable SVG vector. No prior experience needed!

<Note>
  **Before you begin, make sure you have:**

  - ✓ Vectorized (AI Vectorizer) - Image Tracer installed ([installation guide](/getting-started/installation))
  - ✓ At least 10 credits in your account ([buy credits](/support/credits-pricing))
  - ✓ A bitmap image (PNG or JPG) in your Figma file to vectorize

  Don't have an image? Use any screenshot or photo already in your Figma file to follow along.
</Note>

---

## Step 1: Select Your Image

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Raster Image">
    Click on any **bitmap/raster image** in your Figma canvas. The plugin works with:

    - 🖼️ **Imported PNG/JPG files**
    - 📋 **Pasted screenshots**
    - 🎨 **Nodes with image fills**
    - 📷 **Drag-and-dropped photos**

   
    <Tip>
      **What kind of images work best?**

      - ✅ **Logos and icons** - Clean, simple shapes
      - ✅ **Flat illustrations** - Limited colors, no gradients
      - ✅ **Line drawings** - Sketches and outlines
      - ⚠️ **Photos** - Work, but may need High-Fidelity preset
      - ❌ **Text** - Better to use Figma text layers directly
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Selection">
    Once you've selected an image, the plugin automatically detects it. You'll see:

    <Check>✓ Image preview appears in the plugin's canvas area (center-right)</Check>
    <Check>✓ "HD Preview" button becomes active (changes from disabled to blue)</Check>
    <Check>✓ "Convert to SVG" button is enabled at the bottom</Check>
    <Check>✓ Settings panel remains available on the left</Check>


    <Warning>
      **Not seeing the image preview?**

      Common issues and fixes:

      - **No image fill**: Make sure the selected node actually contains an image (not just a solid color fill)
      - **Image not loaded**: Wait for the image to fully load in Figma first
      - **Wrong format**: Plugin works with PNG/JPG only (not SVG, PDF, or video)
      - **Locked/Hidden layer**: Unlock and make visible

      **Still not working?** Try:
      1. Right-click the image → Copy
      2. Create a new rectangle (`R` key)
      3. Paste the image as fill (`Cmd/Ctrl + V`)
      4. Select the rectangle
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optional: Prepare Your Image">
    For best results, consider these quick optimizations:

    <Accordion title="🎯 Remove Background">
      If your image has a background you don't need, remove it before vectorizing:
      - Use Figma's background removal tool
      - Or use a service like remove.bg
      - Clean backgrounds produce cleaner vectors
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="🔍 Increase Contrast">
      For sketches and line art:
      - Adjust brightness/contrast in Figma
      - Makes lines more defined
      - Results in cleaner vector paths
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="✂️ Crop to Subject">
      Remove unnecessary space:
      - Frame the main subject tightly
      - Reduces processing time
      - Focuses vectorization on what matters
    </Accordion>

    <Note>
      These optimizations are optional! The plugin works great with raw images too. Feel free to skip if you're just testing.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Card>

---

## Step 3: Preview Your Result (Recommended)

Before spending 10 credits on the final conversion, use **HD Preview** to test your settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'HD Preview' Button">
    
    **Cost**: 2 credits (5x cheaper than full conversion!)

    **What you get**:
    - Full-resolution preview with watermark
    - Zoom and pan controls
    - Side-by-side comparison
    - Verify settings before committing

    Click the blue "HD Preview" button to start processing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Processing">
    Processing typically takes:
    - **Simple images**: 3-8 seconds
    - **Medium complexity**: 8-15 seconds
    - **Complex images**: 15-30 seconds
    - **High-Fidelity preset**: 30-60 seconds

    You'll see a loading indicator with the message "Generating preview..."

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the Preview">
    Once complete, a modal window opens showing your vectorized preview:


    **Preview features**:
    - 🔍 **Zoom controls**: Inspect details at 400% zoom
    - 👆 **Pan**: Click and drag to move around
    - 🖼️ **Comparison slider**: See before/after side-by-side
    - ✅ **Convert button**: Go straight to full conversion if satisfied

    <Accordion title="What to check in your preview">
      <Tabs>
        <Tab title="✓ Edges & Smoothness">
          **Look for**:
          - Are curves smooth and clean?
          - Any jagged/stair-step edges?
          - Sharp corners preserved?

          **If not good**:
          - Increase **Quality** to High or Ultra
          - Lower **Detail** if too many small shapes
        </Tab>

        <Tab title="✓ Colors">
          **Look for**:
          - Main colors accurately captured?
          - Gradients handled well?
          - Any unwanted color shifts?

          **If not good**:
          - Increase **Colors** setting (try 64 or 256)
          - Try a different preset
        </Tab>

        <Tab title="✓ Details">
          **Look for**:
          - Important features preserved?
          - Too much noise/speckling?
          - Missing fine lines?

          **If not good**:
          - Increase **Detail** slider if losing features
          - Decrease **Detail** if seeing noise
        </Tab>

        <Tab title="✓ Overall Quality">
          **Ask yourself**:
          - Would I use this in my design?
          - Does it match my expectations?
          - Clean enough to edit in Figma?

          **If not good**:
          - Try a different **Preset**
          - Adjust **Quality** and **Detail**
          - Preview again (only 2 more credits)
        </Tab>
      </Tabs>
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust Settings (If Needed)">
    If the preview isn't perfect, close the modal and tweak your settings:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Problem: Edges look blocky/jagged" icon="triangle-exclamation">
        **Solution**: Increase **Quality**

        1. Move Quality slider to **High** or **Ultra**
        2. Click HD Preview again (2 credits)
        3. Compare results

        **Why it works**: Higher quality = smoother, more precise curves
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Problem: Too many dots/noise/artifacts" icon="triangle-exclamation">
        **Solution**: Decrease **Detail**

        1. Move Detail slider LEFT (toward "Less")
        2. Try Detail value of **30-40**
        3. Preview again

        **Why it works**: Lower detail removes small shapes (noise, JPG artifacts)
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Problem: Colors look wrong or limited" icon="triangle-exclamation">
        **Solution**: Increase **Colors**

        1. Change Colors from dropdown (try **64** or **256**)
        2. Preview again
        3. Or try **Unlimited** for maximum color accuracy

        **Why it works**: More colors = more accurate color representation
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Problem: Lost important details" icon="triangle-exclamation">
        **Solution**: Increase **Detail** or switch Preset

        1. Move Detail slider RIGHT (toward "More")
        2. Try Detail value of **70-80**
        3. Or switch to **High-Fidelity** preset

        **Why it works**: Higher detail preserves smaller shapes and features
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Problem: Wrong style (filled shapes vs lines)" icon="triangle-exclamation">
        **Solution**: Change Draw Style or Preset

        1. Go to **Style** section in settings
        2. Change **Draw Style** to:
           - **Fill** for solid shapes (default)
           - **Stroke** for line outlines
           - **Edges** for edge outlines only
        3. Or switch to **Line Art** preset for stroke-based output

        **Why it works**: Different draw styles create different vector types
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    <Tip>
      **Preview is cheap!** Each preview only costs 2 credits vs 10 for full conversion. Don't be afraid to preview multiple times with different settings until you're happy!
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Skip Preview (Optional)">
    If you're confident with your preset choice, you can skip HD Preview and go straight to conversion.

    **When to skip**:
    - You're familiar with the presets
    - Simple image with predictable results
    - You're okay with potential re-conversion

    **When NOT to skip**:
    - First time using a preset
    - Complex or important image
    - Unsure about settings
    - Want to save credits (preview first = avoid re-conversion)

    <Note>
      **Pro users** skip preview for routine conversions, but **new users** should always preview first to learn how settings affect results!
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 4: Convert to SVG

Once you're happy with the preview (or if you skipped preview), it's time for the final conversion!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Convert to SVG'">

    **Cost**: 10 credits (no watermark)

    **What happens**:
    - Image is processed with your chosen settings
    - High-quality SVG is generated
    - Result automatically placed in Figma
    - Your credit balance updates

    Click the green "Convert to SVG" button at the bottom of the plugin.

    <Note>
      **Don't have 10 credits?**

      The plugin will automatically generate a **watermarked preview** for free. You can still see the result, but you'll need credits to get the clean, usable SVG.

      [Purchase credits now →](/support/credits-pricing)
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Processing">
    Processing time varies by image complexity:

    | Image Type | Expected Time |
    |------------|---------------|
    | Simple logo | 5-10 seconds |
    | Illustration | 10-20 seconds |
    | Line art | 15-25 seconds |
    | High-Fidelity | 30-60 seconds |

    

    The button shows "Converting..." and you'll see a progress indicator.

    <Warning>
      **Taking longer than 2 minutes?**

      - Check your internet connection
      - Try reducing Quality or Detail settings
      - Complex images with High-Fidelity can take up to 90 seconds
      - If it fails, you'll see an error message and credits will be refunded
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="SVG Automatically Added to Figma">
    When conversion completes, several things happen automatically:

    <Check>✅ SVG is placed **next to your original image** on the canvas</Check>
    <Check>✅ New SVG is **automatically selected** (ready to move/edit)</Check>
    <Check>✅ Success notification appears: "✓ SVG converted successfully!"</Check>
    <Check>✅ Your **credit balance updates** in the plugin</Check>
    <Check>✅ Viewport **scrolls** to show both original and result</Check>


    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: The original image stays untouched. Compare them side-by-side, then delete the original once you're satisfied!
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common First-Time Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="❌ No image preview appears in the plugin" icon="image-slash">
    **Checklist**:
    - ☐ Did you select a node with an **image fill**? (not text or shapes)
    - ☐ Is the image fully loaded in Figma?
    - ☐ Is it a PNG or JPG format? (not SVG, PDF, or video)
    - ☐ Is the layer visible and unlocked?

    **Solutions**:
    1. Try **right-clicking** the image → Plugins → Vectorized (AI Vectorizer) - Image Tracer
    2. Copy image, paste as fill on a rectangle, select rectangle
    3. Refresh the plugin (`Cmd/Ctrl + R` in Figma)
    4. Check [troubleshooting guide](/support/troubleshooting) for more help
  </Accordion>

    | Jagged edges | Quality too low | Increase Quality to High/Ultra |
    | Too many dots | Detail too high | Decrease Detail to 30-40 |
    | Wrong colors | Colors setting too low | Increase Colors to 64/256 |
    | Lost details | Detail too low | Increase Detail to 70-80 |
    | Wrong style | Wrong preset | Try different preset or change Draw Style |

    **Best practice**: Use HD Preview (2 credits) to test before full conversion!

  <Accordion title="❌ Processing takes too long (>2 minutes)" icon="clock">
    **Expected times**:
    - Simple images: 5-15 seconds
    - Medium complexity: 15-30 seconds
    - High-Fidelity preset: 30-90 seconds

    **If longer than 2 minutes**:
    1. Check internet connection
    2. Try refreshing Figma
    3. Reduce image complexity:
       - Lower Quality to Standard
       - Decrease Detail
       - Use smaller original image
    4. Avoid High-Fidelity preset for testing

    **Still stuck?** Contact support with details about your image size and settings.

  <Accordion title="❌ Credits deducted but no result" icon="coins">
    **This shouldn't happen!** But if it does:

    1. **Check canvas**: SVG might be placed far from viewport
       - Press `Shift + 1` to zoom to see all
       - Look for new layer in layers panel
    2. **Check Figma notifications**: Error message may appear
    3. **Wait 60 seconds**: Network delay possible
    4. **If truly lost**: Contact support immediately
       - Include timestamp
       - Screenshot of credit balance
       - We'll refund lost credits

    **Note**: If conversion fails due to error, credits are automatically refunded within 1 minute.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="❌ SVG looks different than preview" icon="not-equal">
    **Small differences are normal** due to:
    - Preview is PNG representation
    - Final SVG has precise vector math
    - Figma rendering vs web rendering

    **If drastically different**:
    1. Check if you changed settings after preview
    2. Make sure you clicked Convert (not Preview again)
    3. Try converting again with same settings
    4. Contact support if consistently different

    **Tip**: Previews are 95%+ accurate. Minor differences in fine details are expected.
