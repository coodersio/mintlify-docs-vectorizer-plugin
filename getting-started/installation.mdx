## Troubleshooting Installation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Plugin doesn't appear in my plugins list" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Plugin wasn't installed successfully
    - You're looking in the wrong Figma account
    - Browser/Desktop cache issue

    **Solutions:**
    1. Try installing again using the [direct link](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1528574912559745892/vectorized-ai-vectorizer-image-tracer)
    2. Check if you're signed into the correct Figma account
    3. Clear browser cache (Browser version) or restart Figma (Desktop version)
    4. Check Figma Community to verify installation status
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plugin panel is blank or won't load" icon="spinner">
    **Possible causes:**
    - No internet connection
    - Firewall/VPN blocking the plugin
    - Outdated Figma version

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check internet connection** - Plugin requires online access
    2. **Disable VPN/proxy** temporarily to test
    3. **Update Figma** to the latest version
    4. **Restart Figma** completely (quit and reopen)
    5. Try in a **different browser** (if using Browser version)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Insufficient permissions' error" icon="lock">
    **What this means:**
    The plugin needs certain permissions to function, but they weren't granted during installation.

    **Solution:**
    1. **Uninstall** the plugin:
       - Go to Resources (`Shift + I`) → Plugins
       - Right-click on Vectorized (AI Vectorizer) - Image Tracer
       - Select "Remove plugin"
    2. **Reinstall** using the direct link
    3. **Accept all permissions** when prompted
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find the plugin after installation" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Try these locations:**

    1. **Resources Panel** (`Shift + I`) → Plugins tab
    2. **Quick Actions** (`Cmd/Ctrl + /`) → Type "Vec"
    3. **Menu Bar** → Plugins → Vectorized (AI Vectorizer) - Image Tracer

    If still not found, reinstall the plugin.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plugin works on Desktop but not Browser (or vice versa)" icon="laptop-mobile">
    **This is normal behavior**

    Plugins installed on Desktop aren't automatically available in Browser, and vice versa. You need to:

    - **Install separately** in each environment
    - Use the same Figma account
    - Credits are shared across both versions
