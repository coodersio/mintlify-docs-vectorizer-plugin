## Why Vectorize Your Images?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="🔍 Scale Infinitely Without Quality Loss" icon="maximize">
    Vector graphics remain perfectly crisp at any size—from tiny mobile icons to massive billboard prints. No more pixelation when you zoom in or scale up. Perfect for responsive designs, multi-device support, and high-resolution displays.

    **Use cases**: Logo systems, icon libraries, scalable UI components, print materials
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✏️ Fully Editable in Figma" icon="pen-to-square">
    Once converted, your SVG becomes a native Figma vector. Modify colors, adjust shapes, edit paths, and apply Boolean operations—all with Figma's powerful vector editing tools. No need to go back to the original bitmap.

    **Unlock**: Color customization, shape modification, component creation, design system integration
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="📦 Dramatically Smaller File Sizes" icon="box">
    SVG files are typically 5-10x smaller than PNG equivalents, leading to faster page loads, reduced bandwidth usage, and better performance across your designs and websites.

    **Benefits**: Faster prototypes, quicker exports, improved web performance, lower storage costs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🎨 Design System Ready" icon="palette">
    Vectorized assets integrate seamlessly into your component libraries. Create color variants, swap instances, and maintain consistency across your entire design system.

    **Perfect for**: Component libraries, design tokens, brand assets, reusable UI elements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="♿ Accessibility & SEO Benefits" icon="universal-access">
    SVGs support alt text, can be indexed by search engines, and scale perfectly for users with visual impairments who need to zoom in. Better for everyone.

    **Advantages**: Screen reader support, searchable content, responsive accessibility, semantic markup
