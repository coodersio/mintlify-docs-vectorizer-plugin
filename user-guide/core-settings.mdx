## Understanding Core Settings

Core settings give you **professional-level control** over how your images are vectorized. While [presets](/user-guide/understanding-presets) are great starting points, mastering these settings lets you optimize for any image.

<Note>
  **New to settings?** Don't be intimidated! Start with a preset, use HD Preview (2 credits) to test changes, and adjust one setting at a time.
</Note>

## Quality

**Controls**: Curve precision and smoothness


### What Quality Does

Quality determines how accurately vector curves match your original image. Think of it as the **"smoothness vs precision"** slider.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Higher Quality" icon="gem" color="#16A34A">
    **More precise curves**
    - Tighter curve fitting
    - Smoother edges when zoomed
    - Larger file sizes
    - Slower processing
  </Card>

  <Card title="Lower Quality" icon="bolt" color="#3B82F6">
    **Faster processing**
    - Looser curve fitting
    - May show stair-stepping
    - Smaller file sizes
    - Quick results

## Detail

**Controls**: How small of details are preserved (noise filtering)



### What Detail Does

Detail controls the **minimum size of shapes** that are kept in the output. Lower detail = more aggressive noise removal. Higher detail = preserve smaller features.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Higher Detail (70-100)" icon="magnifying-glass-plus">
    **Preserve small features**
    - Keeps fine details
    - More complex output
    - Larger file sizes
    - May include noise/artifacts
  </Card>

  <Card title="Lower Detail (0-30)" icon="broom">
    **Aggressive cleanup**
    - Removes noise and artifacts
    - Simpler, cleaner output
    - Smaller file sizes
    - May lose important details
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How Detail Mapping Works

**Technical**: Detail slider (0-100) maps to `min_area_px` (5.0-0.5)

```
Detail 0   → min_area_px 5.0  (remove shapes < 5px²)
Detail 50  → min_area_px 2.75 (remove shapes < 2.75px²)
Detail 100 → min_area_px 0.5  (keep almost everything)
```

**In plain English**: The slider tells the AI "ignore anything smaller than X pixels"

### Detail Level Guide

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Low Detail (0-30)">

## Colors

**Controls**: Maximum number of colors in output (color quantization)



### What Colors Does

The Colors setting limits how many distinct colors appear in your vectorized output. The algorithm analyzes your image and reduces the palette to the specified number.

<Note>
  **This is color quantization**, similar to saving a GIF with limited colors. The AI intelligently picks the most representative colors.
</Note>

## Draw Style

**Controls**: How shapes are rendered (fills vs strokes)



### What Draw Style Does

Draw Style fundamentally changes how your vector is constructed. This is a **visual style choice**, not a quality setting.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fill Shapes">
    **Default for 90% of cases**

    **How it works**:
    - Closed shapes filled with solid colors
    - Like "coloring inside the lines"
    - Standard vector illustration style

    **Best for**:
    - ✅ Logos
    - ✅ Icons
    - ✅ Flat illustrations
    - ✅ General graphics
    - ✅ Most use cases

    **Advantages**:
    - Colors are accurate
    - Easy to recolor (just change fill)
    - Familiar editing style
    - Works like Figma shapes

    **Output example**:
    ```
    <path fill="#FF5733" d="..."/>
    <path fill="#3498DB" d="..."/>
    ```

    
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Stroke Shapes">
    **Line Art preset default**

    **How it works**:
    - Paths with stroke weight
    - Like "drawing with a pen"
    - Outlines, not fills

    **Best for**:
    - ✅ Hand-drawn sketches
    - ✅ Line art / ink drawings
    - ✅ Technical drawings
    - ✅ Coloring book pages
    - ✅ When you'll add colors later

    **Advantages**:
    - Preserves "hand-drawn" feel
    - Can adjust stroke width after
    - Perfect for outlines
    - Great for further illustration

    **Output example**:
    ```
    <path stroke="#000000" stroke-width="2" fill="none" d="..."/>
    ```

    

    <Tip>
      **After converting**: Select all paths and change Stroke weight in Figma to make lines thicker/thinner!
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Stroke Edges">
    **Specialized effect**

    **How it works**:
    - Only color boundaries are stroked
    - Creates outline effect
    - Very minimal style

    **Best for**:
    - ⚠️ Special artistic effects
    - ⚠️ Outline-only graphics
    - ⚠️ Experimental styles

    **Characteristics**:
    - Very simple output

## Fill Gaps

**Controls**: Fixes white-line rendering bugs



### What Fill Gaps Does

Fill Gaps solves a **technical rendering problem** where thin white lines appear between shapes at certain zoom levels. This is a browser/renderer limitation, not a design flaw.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Problem" icon="bug" color="#EF4444">
    **Without Fill Gaps**:

    - Tiny gaps between shapes
    - Visible at certain zoom levels
    - Especially on web/mobile
    - Looks unprofessional
  </Card>

  <Card title="Solution" icon="check-circle" color="#16A34A">
    **With Fill Gaps**:

    - Micro-overlaps at edges
    - Gaps eliminated
    - Smooth rendering
    - Professional quality
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How Fill Gaps Works

**Technical**: Adds tiny overlaps (0.5-5px) between adjacent shapes

**Visual impact**: None when viewed normally, but eliminates rendering gaps

**When you'll notice the problem**:
- Web browsers at non-100% zoom
- Mobile devices (different pixel densities)
- Exported SVGs on websites
- PDFs at certain zoom levels

### Fill Gaps Settings

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Enabled (Recommended)">
    ⭐ **Default for Logo, Illustration, High-Fidelity presets**

    **When to enable**:
    - ✅ Graphics for web use
    - ✅ App icons and UI
    - ✅ Logos for websites
    - ✅ Any SVG exported for digital use
    - ✅ **Almost always!**

    **Benefits**:
    - No white line artifacts
    - Smooth rendering everywhere
    - Professional appearance
    - No downside for digital use

    **Stroke Width**: Default 2.0px works great for most images
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Disabled">
    **Default for Line Art preset only**

    **When to disable**:
    - Line art/sketches (gaps are intentional)
    - Technical drawings (precision required)
    - Print-only graphics (rendering bug rare in print)

    **Why Line Art disables it**:
    - Strokes already overlap naturally
    - Gaps between lines are intentional
    - Fill gaps would merge separate lines

    **Rare use case**: Most users keep it enabled
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Stroke Width (Advanced)

**Only available when Fill Gaps is enabled**

Controls how much overlap is added at shape boundaries.

| Stroke Width | Use Case |
|--------------|----------|
| **0.5-1.0px** | Subtle overlap, minimal effect |
| **2.0px** ⭐ | Default, works for 95% of images |
| **3.0-5.0px** | Aggressive overlap, for problem images |

<Tip>
  **Default (2.0px) works great for almost everyone**. Only adjust if you still see white lines after converting.
</Tip>
