## Advanced Features Overview

Advanced features give **power users** fine-grained control beyond presets and core settings. Most users won't need these, but they unlock powerful workflows for specific use cases.

<Warning>
  **Note**: These are truly "advanced" features. If you're new to the plugin, master [presets](/user-guide/understanding-presets) and [core settings](/user-guide/core-settings) first!
</Warning>

## Custom Palette

**Force vectorization to use only specific colors**



### What Custom Palette Does

Custom Palette restricts the output SVG to **only use colors you specify**. The AI will map all colors in your original image to the nearest color in your palette.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Case" icon="palette">
    **Brand color compliance**

    Ensure output only uses official brand colors from your design system
  </Card>

  <Card title="Limitation" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **May change appearance**

    Original colors will be mapped to closest palette color (can look different)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### When to Use Custom Palette

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="✅ Good Use Cases">
    **1. Brand Color Enforcement**
    - Converting logo to match brand guidelines
    - Design system with strict color palette
    - Corporate identity compliance

    **Example**: Your brand uses `#FF5733`, `#3498DB`, `#2ECC71`. Force all output colors to these three.

    **2. Simplifying Color Management**
    - Limit to 3-5 colors for easier editing
    - Create consistent style across multiple images
    - Batch vectorization with same palette

    **Example**: Vectorize 10 illustrations, all use same 5-color palette.

    **3. Color Correction**
    - Original has color drift (photos)
    - Standardize slightly different shades
    - Lock to specific print colors (Pantone)

    **Example**: Multiple logos with slight color variations → standardize to exact brand colors.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="❌ Not Recommended For">
    **1. Complex Illustrations**
    - Too many subtle color variations
    - Gradients and shading
    - Photos or realistic images

    **Why**: Forcing to limited palette ruins quality

    **2. First Conversion Attempt**
    - Don't know what colors are needed yet
    - Better to see natural result first
    - Can always reconvert with palette

    **Why**: See original conversion first, then decide palette

    **3. When Figma Recoloring is Easier**
    - Small number of colors
    - Easy to recolor in Figma after
    - More flexible workflow

    **Why**: Manual recoloring gives you more control
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### How to Use Custom Palette

<Steps>
  <Step title="Expand Advanced Section">

    Click the **"Advanced"** section header in settings to expand it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter HEX Color">

    1. Type or paste HEX color code in the input (e.g., `#FF5733`)
    2. Must be valid 6-digit HEX format
    3. Click **"Add"** button

    **Format requirements**:
    - ✅ `#FF5733` (correct)
    - ✅ `#ff5733` (lowercase ok)
    - ❌ `FF5733` (missing #)
    - ❌ `#F73` (shorthand not supported)
    - ❌ `rgb(255, 87, 51)` (not HEX)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Multiple Colors">

    Repeat for each color in your palette. You can add:
    - **Minimum**: 2 colors
    - **Recommended**: 4-8 colors
    - **Maximum**: No limit (but diminishing returns)

    **Each color appears as a chip** showing:
    - Color swatch preview
    - HEX code
    - "×" to remove
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove Colors (Optional)">
    Click the **"×"** on any color chip to remove it from the palette.

    Useful for experimenting with different combinations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview with Palette">
    Click **HD Preview** (2 credits) to see how your image looks with the restricted palette.

    **Important**: Preview before full conversion! Palette can dramatically change appearance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust if Needed">
    If preview doesn't look good:
    - Add more colors to the palette
    - Change specific colors
    - Remove palette entirely (clear all colors)
    - Try different core settings

    Preview again to compare (2 credits each).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Custom Palette Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with more colors, reduce later" icon="arrow-down">
    **Best workflow**:

    1. First conversion: Use **no palette** (see natural colors)
    2. Examine what colors are actually used
    3. Extract 4-8 main colors
    4. Reconvert with those colors as palette
    5. Iterate if needed

    **Why**: You need to see what colors exist first!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use eyedropper to extract colors" icon="eyedropper">
    **Get colors from original image**:

    1. Select your original image in Figma
    2. Use eyedropper tool on main colors
    3. Copy HEX codes from fill panel
    4. Paste into Custom Palette input

    **Tip**: Focus on the 5-10 most prominent colors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many colors do you need?" icon="question">
    **Color count recommendations**:

    | Image Type | Recommended Palette Size |
    |------------|-------------------------|
    | Simple logo | 2-4 colors |
    | Brand identity | 3-6 colors (brand palette) |
    | Flat illustration | 6-10 colors |
    | Complex artwork | Don't use palette (too limiting) |

    **Rule of thumb**: If you need more than 10 colors, palette probably isn't the right tool.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combine with Colors setting" icon="sliders">
    **Custom Palette vs Colors setting**:

    - **Colors setting**: Limits total number of colors (AI picks which ones)
    - **Custom Palette**: Forces specific colors (you choose which ones)

    **Can use together**:
    - Set Colors to 16
    - Add 5 colors to Custom Palette
    - Output will use those 5 colors, but not exceed 16 total (including shades)

    **Typical workflow**: Use palette alone, ignore Colors setting
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Palette affects processing time" icon="clock">
    **Performance impact**:

    - Small palette (2-5 colors): Slightly faster processing
    - Large palette (20+ colors): Slightly slower
    - Difference is minimal (1-3 seconds)

    **Not a performance optimization tool** — use for color control only.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common Custom Palette Scenarios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Scenario 1: Brand Compliance">
    **Situation**: Client logo in wrong colors, need exact brand colors

    **Original**: Logo downloaded from website, colors are `#E84C3D` (close to brand red)

    **Brand Color**: `#FF0000` (official red)

    **Solution**:
    1. Add brand colors to palette: `#FF0000`, `#FFFFFF`, `#000000`
    2. Preview conversion
    3. Logo now uses exact brand colors
    4. Submit to client with confidence!

    
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Scenario 2: Design System Colors">
    **Situation**: Vectorizing multiple illustrations for design system

    **Goal**: All illustrations use same color palette for consistency

    **Design System Colors**:
    - Primary: `#3B82F6`
    - Secondary: `#10B981`
    - Accent: `#F59E0B`
    - Text: `#1F2937`
    - Background: `#F3F4F6`

    **Solution**:
    1. Add all 5 colors to Custom Palette
    2. Use for all illustration conversions
    3. Consistent color scheme across assets
    4. Easy to update later (global color styles)

    
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Scenario 3: Print Color Matching">
    **Situation**: Converting illustrations for print, need specific Pantone colors

    **Goal**: Match print shop's Pantone color requirements

    **Pantone Colors** (converted to HEX):
    - Pantone 185 C: `#E4002B`
    - Pantone 301 C: `#005EB8`
    - Pantone 116 C: `#FFCD00`

    **Solution**:
    1. Convert Pantone to HEX (use online converter)
    2. Add to Custom Palette
    3. Vectorize with palette
    4. Export SVG for print production

    **Note**: HEX approximation of Pantone, print shop will apply actual Pantone inks
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Custom Palette Limitations

<Warning>
  **Important limitations to understand**:

  1. **Colors may look different**: Forcing colors can change image appearance significantly
  2. **Loss of subtle variations**: Gradients and shading will be posterized
  3. **Not a replacement for recoloring**: Often easier to recolor in Figma after conversion
  4. **Requires color knowledge**: Need to know exact colors you want upfront
  5. **Can't undo after conversion**: Must reconvert if palette is wrong

  **Recommendation**: Use sparingly and always preview first!
</Warning>

## Stroke Width (Line Art Mode)

**Adjust line thickness for stroke-based output**



### What Stroke Width Controls

When using **Line Art preset** or manually selecting **"Stroke Shapes"** draw style, this setting controls the thickness of the stroke paths.

**Technical**: Sets the `stroke-width` attribute in the SVG (0.5-10px)

<Note>
  **Only available when**:
  - Draw Style is set to "Stroke Shapes" or "Stroke Edges"
  - Line Art preset is selected (automatically uses Stroke)
</Note>

    **Best for**:
    - Fine line work
    - Detailed sketches
    - Technical drawings
    - Delicate illustrations

    **Appearance**:
    - Very thin, precise lines
    - Good for intricate details
    - May be hard to see at small sizes

    
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Medium (2.0-4.0px)">
    ⭐ **Default: 2.0px**

    **Best for**:
    - Most hand-drawn sketches
    - General line art
    - Coloring pages
    - Standard illustrations

    **Appearance**:
    - Visible and clear
    - Balanced thickness
    - Works at most sizes

    **Recommended starting point**

    
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Thick (4.0-10.0px)">
    **Best for**:
    - Bold artwork
    - Comics/manga style
    - High contrast
    - Marker/brush drawings

    **Appearance**:
    - Heavy, prominent lines
    - Strong visual impact
    - Good for small display sizes

    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Adjusting Stroke Width

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Line Art Preset or Stroke Style">
    **Option 1**: Choose **Line Art** preset (automatically uses Stroke Shapes)

    **Option 2**: Any preset + manually set Draw Style to "Stroke Shapes"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Expand Advanced Section">
    Stroke Width setting appears in Advanced when Stroke is active.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust Slider">

    - **Range**: 0.5px - 10.0px
    - **Default**: 2.0px
    - **Increment**: 0.5px steps

    Move slider or type exact value.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview Result">
    Use HD Preview (2 credits) to see how the stroke width looks.

    **Check**:
    - Are lines too thin/thick?
    - Appropriate for your use case?
    - Visible at target size?
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Stroke Width Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="You can adjust stroke width AFTER converting!" icon="wand-magic">
    **Big advantage of stroke-based output**:

    After vectorizing in Figma:
    1. Select all paths (`Cmd/Ctrl + A`)
    2. Change **Stroke** weight in properties panel
    3. Make lines thicker or thinner
    4. **No need to reconvert!**

    **This is why Stroke Width setting isn't critical** — you can change it later for free.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Match original line thickness" icon="ruler">
    **Best practice**:

    1. Zoom in on original image
    2. Estimate average line thickness (in pixels)
    3. Set Stroke Width to similar value
    4. Preview to verify

    **Example**: Original sketch has ~3px lines → set Stroke Width to 3.0
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider target display size" icon="mobile">
    **Stroke width affects readability at different sizes**:

    | Display Size | Recommended Stroke |
    |-------------|-------------------|
    | Small icon (64px) | 3-5px (thicker) |
    | Medium graphic (500px) | 2-3px (standard) |
    | Large illustration (2000px) | 1-2px (thinner) |

    Thicker strokes for smaller displays!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Convert strokes to fills if needed" icon="fill">
    **After converting, you can solidify strokes**:

    1. Select stroke-based SVG
    2. Right-click → **Outline Stroke**
    3. Strokes become filled shapes
    4. Now you can fill with colors!

    **Use case**: Line art → Outline Stroke → Manual coloring
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## HD Preview vs Full Conversion

**Strategic use of preview mode**

### Cost Breakdown

| Mode | Credits | Output | Use For |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| **HD Preview** | 2 | PNG with watermark | Testing settings |
| **Convert to SVG** | 10 | Clean SVG | Final output |

**Cost ratio**: Preview is **5x cheaper** than conversion!

### HD Preview Strategy

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Preview When...">
    **1. Testing New Preset**
    - First time using a preset on this type of image
    - Want to compare multiple presets
    - Costs only 2 credits per test

    **Workflow**:
    1. Try Logo preset → Preview (2 credits)
    2. Try Illustration preset → Preview (2 credits)
    3. Pick best one → Convert (10 credits)
    4. **Total**: 14 credits vs 30 credits if you converted all three

    **2. Adjusting Parameters**
    - Tweaking Quality/Detail/Colors
    - Finding optimal settings
    - Iterative optimization

    **Workflow**:
    1. Start with Detail 50 → Preview (2 credits)
    2. Too noisy, try Detail 30 → Preview (2 credits)
    3. Perfect → Convert (10 credits)
    4. **Total**: 14 credits vs 30 credits

    **3. Unfamiliar Image Type**
    - Never converted this kind of image before
    - Complex or unusual source
    - Want to see what works

    **Workflow**: Preview multiple approaches cheaply before committing

    **4. Client/Team Review**
    - Need approval before final conversion
    - Show preview to stakeholders
    - Avoid reconversion costs
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Skip Preview When...">
    **1. Familiar Workflow**
    - You've done this type of conversion many times
    - Confident in preset choice
    - Know exactly what settings to use

    **Example**: Converting 10 similar logos → first one preview, rest direct convert

    **2. Simple Images**
    - Logo with clean source

## Power User Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create Preset Variations" icon="copy">
    **Build your own mini-presets**:

    1. Start with Illustration preset
    2. Adjust Quality to High
    3. Set Detail to 40
    4. Use this for specific image type
    5. Remember these settings for future

    **Example custom presets**:
    - "Web Icons": Illustration + Detail 30 + 16 colors
    - "Print Graphics": Illustration + Quality High + Detail 60
    - "Clean Logos": Logo + Detail 20 + 8 colors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Similar Images" icon="layer-group">
    **Efficient workflow for multiple images**:

    1. Test settings on first image (use Preview)
    2. Find optimal configuration
    3. **Write down the settings** (screenshot or note)
    4. Apply same settings to all similar images
    5. Direct convert (skip preview) for rest

    **Example**: Converting 20 team headshots → test 1, apply to all 20

    **Savings**: 2 preview + 20 convert = 22 credits vs 40 credits (preview each)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Figma's Post-Processing" icon="wand-sparkles">
    **Don't over-optimize in plugin**:

    Convert with good settings, then:
    - **Simplify** paths in Figma (reduce complexity)
    - **Flatten** overlapping shapes
    - **Boolean operations** to merge/subtract
    - **Manual recolor** (often easier than Custom Palette)

    **Philosophy**: Get 90% there with plugin, polish 10% in Figma
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Save Original Next to Result" icon="clone">
    **Best practice for comparison**:

    1. Convert image → SVG appears next to original
    2. **Don't delete original** immediately
    3. Put both in a frame
    4. Name frame "Logo Conversion - [Date]"
    5. Keep for reference

    **Benefits**:
    - Easy to compare
    - Can reconvert if needed
    - Version history
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Export Settings for Documentation" icon="file-export">
    **Create documentation for your team**:

    1. Screenshot plugin settings panel
    2. Annotate which settings were used
    3. Note results (file size, quality)
    4. Build internal guide

    **Example**: "Team Headshots: Illustration preset, Detail 45, 32 colors = best results"
  </Accordion>
