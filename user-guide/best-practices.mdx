## Scenario 1: Company Logo Vectorization

**Goal**: Convert a client's low-res logo to crisp, editable vector



### Starting Point

**Typical situation**:
- Client sent logo as JPEG from their website
- Visible compression artifacts
- Low resolution (500px wide)
- Need vector for print and web

### Recommended Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the Image">
    **Before converting**:

    1. **Remove background** (if present)
       - Use Figma's background removal
       - Or remove.bg service
       - Clean background = cleaner vectorization

    2. **Check resolution**
       - If under 300px wide, ask client for larger version
       - Tiny logos produce poor results
       - Ideal: 800-2000px wide

    3. **Crop tightly**
       - Remove excessive white space
       - Frame just the logo itself
       - Faster processing + better results
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Settings">
    **Recommended configuration**:

    - **Preset**: Logo
    - **Quality**: Standard (increase to High if edges look rough in preview)
    - **Detail**: 25-30 (aggressive noise removal for JPG artifacts)
    - **Colors**: 16 or fewer (logos rarely need more)
    - **Draw Style**: Fill Shapes
    - **Fill Gaps**: Enabled

    <Tip>
      **Why Detail 25-30**: Removes JPG compression noise while keeping logo clean
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview First">
    Always use **HD Preview** (2 credits) for logos:

    1. Check edge smoothness (zoom to 400%)
    2. Verify colors are correct
    3. Look for unwanted artifacts
    4. If issues, adjust Detail or Quality

    **Common adjustments**:
    - Edges rough? → Increase Quality to High
    - Too many dots? → Decrease Detail to 20
    - Colors wrong? → Reduce Colors to 8 or add Custom Palette
  </Step>

  <Step title="Convert">
    Once preview looks good, click **Convert to SVG** (10 credits).

    SVG appears next to original image.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Post-Processing in Figma">
    **Clean up the result**:

    1. **Flatten overlapping shapes**
       - Select SVG → Right-click → Flatten (`Cmd/Ctrl + E`)
       - Merges layers for easier editing

    2. **Simplify if needed**
       - Right-click → Simplify
       - Reduces anchor points
       - Smaller file size

    3. **Adjust colors to brand**
       - Double-click SVG to enter group
       - Select shapes and apply brand colors
       - Or use Find & Replace color plugins

    4. **Create component**
       - `Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + K` to make component
       - Add to library for reuse
       - Create dark/light variants if needed

    
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Logo-Specific Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="For very simple logos (1-3 colors)" icon="shapes">
    **Ultra-minimal workflow**:

    - Reduce **Colors** to 4 or 8
    - Decrease **Detail** to 15-20
    - Results in very clean, simple vector
    - Smallest possible file size
    - Easy to edit

    **Perfect for**: Wordmarks, simple icons, geometric logos
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="For logos with gradients" icon="gradient">
    **Challenge**: Logos with gradients are tricky

    **Option 1 - Preserve gradient**:
    - Use **Illustration** preset (not Logo)
    - Increase **Colors** to 64 or 256
    - Detail around 50
    - Gradient will be stepped/posterized but preserved

    **Option 2 - Flatten gradient** (recommended):
    - Use **Logo** preset with Detail 30
    - Gradient becomes solid colors
    - Manually recreate gradient in Figma (smoother result)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="For logos with text" icon="font">
    **Important**: Vectorized text becomes shapes (not editable text)

    **Better approach**:
    1. Vectorize logo separately from text
    2. Recreate text in Figma using matching font
    3. Or: Outline text after vectorizing, then adjust in Figma

    **Why**: Editable text is more flexible than traced shapes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Expected Results

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|--------------|
| **File Size** | 5-50 KB |
| **Processing Time** | 5-10 seconds |
| **Quality** | Professional, print-ready |
| **Editability** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Easy |

## Scenario 2: Flat Illustration Vectorization

**Goal**: Convert stock illustration or artwork to editable vector



### Starting Point

**Typical situation**:
- Downloaded illustration from stock site
- PNG format, decent resolution
- Want to customize colors and elements
- For landing page or presentation

### Recommended Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess the Illustration">
    **Check complexity**:

    - **Simple flat** (few colors, clean shapes) → Start with Logo preset
    - **Moderate** (10-20 colors, some detail) → Illustration preset ⭐
    - **Complex** (30+ colors, gradients) → High-Fidelity preset

    Most fall into "Moderate" category → **Illustration preset**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Settings">
    **Recommended for most illustrations**:

    - **Preset**: Illustration
    - **Quality**: Standard
    - **Detail**: 50 (adjust based on texture)
    - **Colors**: 32 (increase to 64 if many colors)
    - **Draw Style**: Fill Shapes
    - **Fill Gaps**: Enabled

    **For textured illustrations**:
    - Increase **Detail** to 60-70 to preserve texture
    - Increase **Colors** to 64

    **For simple flat art**:
    - Decrease **Detail** to 35-40 for cleaner result
    - Colors can stay at 32 or reduce to 16
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview & Iterate">
    1. HD Preview with initial settings (2 credits)
    2. Check if texture/details are preserved
    3. Adjust Detail up/down as needed
    4. Preview again (2 more credits)
    5. Repeat until satisfied

    **Budget**: 4-6 credits in previews is normal for getting it right
  </Step>

  <Step title="Convert">
    Once settings are dialed in, convert (10 credits).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize in Figma">
    **Common edits for illustrations**:

    1. **Recolor for brand**
       - Enter SVG group
       - Select shapes by color
       - Apply design system colors

    2. **Remove unwanted elements**
       - Delete specific shapes
       - Hide layers
       - Modify paths

    3. **Add to design system**
       - Create component
       - Make color variants
       - Use as illustration library

    
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Scenario 3: Hand-Drawn Sketch Vectorization

**Goal**: Convert scanned drawing or photo of sketch to editable line art



### Starting Point

**Typical situation**:
- Scanned pencil/ink drawing
- Photo of whiteboard sketch
- Paper texture visible
- Want clean vector paths for further illustration

### Recommended Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Optimize the Scan/Photo">
    **Critical for good results**:

    1. **Increase contrast**
       - In Figma: Effects → Adjust colors
       - Make lines darker, background whiter
       - Removes faint marks

    2. **Crop and rotate**
       - Straighten the sketch
       - Crop to just the drawing
       - Remove border/edges

    3. **Clean up if needed**
       - Erase stray marks in Figma
       - Remove coffee stains, smudges
       - Better input = better output

    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Settings">
    **Recommended configuration**:

    - **Preset**: Line Art
    - **Quality**: High (precise line capture)
    - **Detail**: 70 (preserve fine lines)
    - **Colors**: 8 (mostly black/white)
    - **Draw Style**: Stroke Shapes (automatic with Line Art)
    - **Fill Gaps**: Disabled
    - **Stroke Width**: 2.0-3.0px (match original line thickness)

    **If losing fine lines**:
    - Increase **Detail** to 80-90
    - Increase **Quality** to Ultra
    - Accept larger file size
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview First">
    Always preview scanned sketches:

    1. Check if fine lines are captured
    2. Verify paper texture is removed (not preserved as shapes)
    3. Zoom in to inspect line quality

    **Common issues**:
    - Paper texture → Decrease Detail to 40-50
    - Lines too thin → Increase Stroke Width
    - Missing details → Increase Detail to 80
  </Step>

  <Step title="Convert">
    Convert once settings are right (10 credits).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Post-Processing">
    **Clean up the line art**:

    1. **Adjust stroke width**
       - Select all paths (`Cmd/Ctrl + A`)
       - Change Stroke weight in properties
       - Make uniform or varied

    2. **Manual cleanup**
       - Delete stray paths
       - Connect broken lines
       - Smooth rough sections

    3. **Add colors** (if desired)
       - Option 1: Outline Stroke → Fill shapes → Color
       - Option 2: Add fills behind line art
       - Option 3: Use as coloring page template

    
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Sketch-Specific Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="For very rough/textured sketches" icon="scribble">
    **Challenge**: Paper texture and noise

    **Solution**:
    - **Decrease Detail** to 30-40 (removes texture)
    - **Increase contrast** before converting (makes lines stand out)
    - **Accept some loss** of very faint lines
    - **Manual touchup** after conversion

    **Alternative**: Scan at higher contrast initially
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="For technical drawings/wireframes" icon="drafting-compass">
    **Goal**: Precise, clean lines

    **Settings**:
    - **Line Art** preset
    - **Quality**: Ultra (maximum precision)
    - **Detail**: 60-70 (clean but accurate)
    - **Stroke Width**: 1.0-1.5px (thin, technical)

    **Post-processing**:
    - Use Figma's line snapping
    - Align to pixel grid
    - Create isometric or technical views
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Creating coloring pages" icon="paintbrush">
    **Workflow**:

    1. Vectorize with **Line Art** preset

## Scenario 4: Photo to Vector Art

**Goal**: Convert photo to artistic vector representation



### Starting Point

**Typical situation**:
- Photograph (portrait, product, landscape)
- Want poster/artistic effect
- Not realistic reproduction

<Warning>
  **Important**: Vectorizing photos creates **artistic interpretation**, not photo-realistic reproduction. Manage expectations!
</Warning>

### Recommended Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Photo">
    **Pre-processing helps significantly**:

    1. **Crop to subject**
       - Remove background if possible
       - Focus on main subject
       - Simpler composition = better result

    2. **Adjust exposure/contrast**
       - Well-defined shapes vectorize better
       - Avoid very dark or blown-out areas
       - Increase contrast slightly

    3. **Resize if huge**
       - 2000-3000px max dimension
       - Smaller = faster processing
       - Quality won't improve past certain size
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Conservative">
    **Try Illustration preset first**:

    - **Preset**: Illustration
    - **Quality**: Standard
    - **Detail**: 50
    - **Colors**: 64
    - **Preview** to see result (2 credits)

    **Evaluate**:
    - Too simplified? → Try High-Fidelity
    - Acceptable? → Done! (save 10 credits vs High-Fidelity)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upgrade if Needed">
    **If Illustration loses too much**:

    - **Preset**: High-Fidelity
    - **Quality**: High or Ultra
    - **Detail**: 80
    - **Colors**: 256
    - **Accept**: Larger file (1-2 MB), slower processing

    **Preview first!** (2 credits) — High-Fidelity takes 60 seconds, don't convert blind
  </Step>

  <Step title="Convert">
    Use whichever preset worked best in previews.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Post-Processing">
    **Artistic adjustments**:

    1. **Simplify if too complex**
       - Right-click → Simplify
       - Reduces paths
       - Creates more "poster" effect

    2. **Adjust colors**
       - Increase saturation
       - Apply color overlays
       - Create duotone effect

    3. **Add effects**
       - Background blur
       - Shadows
       - Frames/borders

    <Tip>
      **Artistic approach**: Don't aim for photo realism. Embrace the vector aesthetic!
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Photo-Specific Tips

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Portraits">
    **Challenges**: Skin tones, fine details (hair, eyes)

    **Best approach**:
    - **High-Fidelity** preset
    - **Detail**: 70-80
    - **Colors**: 256 (skin tone gradations)
    - **Simplify after** for artistic effect

    **Alternative**: Use **Illustration** for stylized/cartoon effect
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Products">
    **Goal**: Clean product shot for marketing

    **Settings**:
    - **Illustration** or **High-Fidelity**
    - **Detail**: 60-70
    - **Colors**: 64-256 (depends on product)
    - **Remove background** before converting

    **Post-processing**:
    - Add drop shadow in Figma
    - Place on colored background
    - Create variations (colors/angles)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Landscapes/Scenes">
    **Complex challenge**:

    - **High-Fidelity** required
    - **Detail**: 80
    - **Colors**: 256 or Unlimited
    - **Long processing** time (60-90 seconds)
    - **Large files** (1-3 MB)

    **Consider**: Is vectorization necessary? Photos may be better as photos.

    **Use case**: Stylized backgrounds, poster art
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### When NOT to Vectorize Photos

<Warning>
  **Photos are often better left as photos**:

  - Realistic product photography
  - Portraits for documentation
  - Detailed textures (wood, fabric)
  - Web hero images (use WebP instead)

  **Vectorize photos only for**: Artistic effects, posters, stylized graphics
</Warning>

## General Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always start with higher quality source" icon="image">
    **Input quality determines output quality**:

    | Source Quality | Max Output Quality |
    |---------------|-------------------|
    | 4K+ image | Excellent |
    | 1920-2000px | Very good |
    | 800-1500px | Good |
    | 300-800px | Fair |
    | Under 300px | Poor |

    **Rule**: Garbage in, garbage out. Get the best source possible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use HD Preview liberally" icon="eye">
    **Preview is cheap insurance**:

    - **Cost**: 2 credits (vs 10 for conversion)
    - **Value**: Avoid wasting 10 credits on bad settings
    - **Math**: 3 previews (6 credits) + 1 convert (10) = 16 total
      - vs: 2 bad converts (20) = waste 4 credits

    **Don't skip preview** on unfamiliar image types!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Match settings to end use" icon="target">
    **Optimize for your actual need**:

    | Use Case | Recommended Settings |
    |----------|---------------------|
    | Web icon (64px) | Logo preset, Standard quality |
    | UI graphic (500px) | Illustration, Standard |
    | Print poster | Illustration/High-Fidelity, High quality |
    | Large format | High-Fidelity, Ultra quality |

    Don't use Ultra quality for a 64px icon!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Embrace Figma's post-processing" icon="wand-magic">
    **Plugin gets you 90% there, Figma finishes it**:

    **Common Figma touchups**:
    - Flatten shapes
    - Simplify paths
    - Boolean operations
    - Manual recoloring
    - Component creation

    **Don't obsess** over perfection in plugin — finish in Figma!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build a settings library" icon="book">
    **Document what works**:

    1. Screenshot successful settings
    2. Note image type and settings used
    3. Record file size and quality results
    4. Build internal playbook

    **Example doc**:
    ```
    Company Logos:
    - Preset: Logo
    - Detail: 25
    - Colors: 16
    - Results: 15-40 KB, clean edges
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch similar images with same settings" icon="layer-group">
    **Efficiency workflow**:

    1. Find optimal settings for first image (use Preview)
    2. Write down the settings
    3. Apply to all similar images (skip Preview)
    4. Convert batch

    **Example**: 20 team headshots → test 1, apply to all 20

    **Savings**: Massive time and credit savings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
